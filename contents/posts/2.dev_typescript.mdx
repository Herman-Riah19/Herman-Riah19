## What is TypeScript?

**TypeScript** is a modern, strongly-typed programming language developed and maintained by **Microsoft**. It extends JavaScript by adding a **powerful type system** and advanced features that make it easier to build large, maintainable, and scalable applications.

In simple terms, TypeScript is **JavaScript with superpowers** — everything you can do in JavaScript, you can also do in TypeScript, but with the added benefit of **type checking**, **interfaces**, **classes**, **decorators**, and more.

---

## Why Use TypeScript?

### 1. **Static Typing for Safer Code**
Unlike JavaScript, which is dynamically typed, TypeScript introduces **static typing**, allowing you to define types for variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps detect errors during development, long before your code reaches production.

```typescript
function greetUser(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name.toUpperCase()}!`;
}

console.log(greetUser("TypeScript")); // Works fine
console.log(greetUser(42)); // ❌ Type error detected during compilation
````

### 2. **Improved Developer Experience**

TypeScript integrates deeply with modern editors like **VS Code**, offering intelligent code completion, real-time error checking, and easy refactoring. This boosts productivity and helps maintain cleaner codebases.

### 3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Support**

TypeScript makes it possible to write elegant, object-oriented code using **classes**, **interfaces**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**, bringing the best of classical programming paradigms into JavaScript.

### 4. **Scalability and Maintainability**

In large projects with multiple contributors, having strict types and well-defined interfaces prevents accidental misuse of components and makes the code easier to maintain over time.

### 5. **Full JavaScript Compatibility**

Since TypeScript is a **superset of JavaScript**, all existing JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code. You can gradually adopt TypeScript into an existing JS project without rewriting everything.

## Key Features of TypeScript

### 🔹 Type Annotations and Type Inference

You can explicitly define types or let TypeScript infer them automatically:

```typescript
let age: number = 25;
let username = "John"; // TypeScript infers this as string
```

### 🔹 Interfaces

Interfaces define the shape of an object, ensuring that your code follows a consistent structure.

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email?: string; // optional property
}

function printUser(user: User): void {
  console.log(`User: ${user.name} (ID: ${user.id})`);
}

printUser({ id: 1, name: "Alice" });
```

## Object-Oriented Programming in TypeScript

### 🧱 Classes and Objects

Classes are at the heart of OOP, and TypeScript adds strong typing to them:

```typescript
class Person {
  constructor(public name: string, public age: number) {}

  introduce(): void {
    console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

const john = new Person("John", 30);
john.introduce();
```

### 🧬 Inheritance

You can extend classes to create more specific versions of existing objects.

```typescript
class Developer extends Person {
  constructor(name: string, age: number, public language: string) {
    super(name, age);
  }

  code(): void {
    console.log(`${this.name} is coding in ${this.language}.`);
  }
}

const dev = new Developer("Sarah", 25, "TypeScript");
dev.introduce(); // inherited method
dev.code();      // subclass method
```

### 🔁 Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows different classes to share the same method names with distinct implementations.

```typescript
class Shape {
  area(): number {
    return 0;
  }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
  constructor(public radius: number) {
    super();
  }
  area(): number {
    return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
  }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
  constructor(public width: number, public height: number) {
    super();
  }
  area(): number {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }
}

const shapes: Shape[] = [new Circle(5), new Rectangle(4, 6)];
shapes.forEach(shape => console.log(`Area: ${shape.area()}`));
```

This demonstrates how **polymorphism** makes your code more flexible and extensible.

## Advanced Feature: Decorators in TypeScript

Decorators are one of TypeScript’s most powerful features — they let you **add metadata or modify class behavior** in a clean, declarative way. They are widely used in frameworks like **Angular** and **NestJS**.

### ✨ Example: Class Decorator

```typescript
function Logger(constructor: Function) {
  console.log(`Class created: ${constructor.name}`);
}

@Logger
class Product {
  constructor(public title: string, public price: number) {}
}

const phone = new Product("iPhone", 999);
```

This simple decorator logs a message when the class is instantiated.

### ⚙️ Example: Method Decorator

Method decorators can intercept or modify a method’s behavior.

```typescript
function MeasureExecutionTime(
  target: any,
  propertyName: string,
  descriptor: PropertyDescriptor
) {
  const originalMethod = descriptor.value;

  descriptor.value = function (...args: any[]) {
    const start = performance.now();
    const result = originalMethod.apply(this, args);
    const end = performance.now();
    console.log(`${propertyName} executed in ${(end - start).toFixed(2)}ms`);
    return result;
  };
}

class Calculator {
  @MeasureExecutionTime
  multiply(a: number, b: number): number {
    return a * b;
  }
}

const calc = new Calculator();
calc.multiply(20, 30);
```

Decorators provide an elegant way to **add cross-cutting concerns** such as logging, validation, or performance tracking.

## Getting Started with TypeScript

### 1. **Install TypeScript**

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

### 2. **Compile TypeScript to JavaScript**

```bash
tsc app.ts
```

### 3. **Configure Your Project**

Create a `tsconfig.json` file to manage compiler settings.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strict": true,
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src"
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

TypeScript is more than just a typed superset of JavaScript — it’s a **powerful ecosystem** for building robust, maintainable, and scalable applications.

By embracing features like **classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and decorators**, developers can write cleaner, modular code that scales effortlessly across teams and projects. Whether you’re building front-end interfaces or back-end APIs, TypeScript helps you code with **confidence**, **clarity**, and **consistency**.

In a world where software systems are getting more complex, TypeScript is not just an option — it’s becoming a **necessity** for professional-grade development.
