    "About": "Hey! Iâ€™m Hermann Christian RAZAFINDRANAIVO â€” a full-stack developer who took a detour through Telecommunications, graduated in 2020, and then quickly realized: Iâ€™d rather build on the web than debug radio signals ðŸ˜….  \n So I made the switch. I dove into web development, and never looked back.  \n  \n For a while, I worked on local projects, building my skills and exploring tools that actually made coding fun â€” like Next.js, TypeScript, Django, and Flask. But the real shift came in 2024, when I started working online and got into freelancing. That opened the door to remote work, diverse projects, and the kind of creative freedom Iâ€™d been looking for.  \n  \n ðŸ’¬ My motto? *Plan before you code, structure before function, and clean, maintainable code above all.* Because a well-thought-out project saves time, headaches, and a whole lot of debugging rage later ðŸ˜…. â€” future-you will thank you.  \n  \n Now, when it comes to tech choices, Iâ€™m definitely the kind of dev who cares about performance. I love building apps that are **fast**, **scalable**, andâ€”most importantlyâ€”**still make sense after 3 months away from the repo**. I'm the kind of dev who would reach for **Rust** on demanding projects, or use **Bun** instead of raw Node.js, because performance isnâ€™t a luxuryâ€”it's the baseline.  \n So yeah â€” I love building things that are fast, scalable, and actually maintainable. Whether itâ€™s backend logic, clean API integrations, or smooth frontend UIs, I focus on delivering solutions that donâ€™t just work â€” they feel good to use.  \n \n ðŸ“Œ I often work freelance and remotely, and Iâ€™m always open to new challengesâ€”especially the kind that push my skills further. So if youâ€™re looking for a developer who codes clean, thinks fast, and loves to build things that *just work*, youâ€™re in the right place."
