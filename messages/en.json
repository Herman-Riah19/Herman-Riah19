    "About": "Hey! I’m Hermann Christian RAZAFINDRANAIVO — a full-stack developer who took a detour through Telecommunications, graduated in 2020, and then quickly realized: I’d rather build on the web than debug radio signals 😅.  \n So I made the switch. I dove into web development, and never looked back.  \n  \n For a while, I worked on local projects, building my skills and exploring tools that actually made coding fun — like Next.js, TypeScript, Django, and Flask. But the real shift came in 2024, when I started working online and got into freelancing. That opened the door to remote work, diverse projects, and the kind of creative freedom I’d been looking for.  \n  \n 💬 My motto? *Plan before you code, structure before function, and clean, maintainable code above all.* Because a well-thought-out project saves time, headaches, and a whole lot of debugging rage later 😅. — future-you will thank you.  \n \n 📌 I often work freelance and remotely, and I’m always open to new challenges—especially the kind that push my skills further. So if you’re looking for a developer who codes clean, thinks fast, and loves to build things that *just work*, you’re in the right place."
